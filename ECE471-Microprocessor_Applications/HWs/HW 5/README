ECE471 HW5 -- Fall 2018

Name:	Spencer Goulette


7.	Describe what your "something cool" code does
	
	My something cool is that ECE471 scrolls from right to left.

8.
 a). The VideoCore GPU core is in charge of the initial boot process. In most other ARM devices, the ARM chip runs the first-stage boot loader (often MLO) and its second-stage boot loader (uboot).
 b). The /boot partition on the Pi is a FAT32 filesystem because it is simple and uses low memory, plus it is free to use since the parent expired. Also, the boot firmware is smart enough to mount a FAT partition.
 c). The boot loader is the code/program responsible for loading the kernel into memory and running it. Start.elf is what initializes things and loads and boots Linux kernel.img.
 d). The optional parameters first and last limit the scanning range from 0x03 to 0x77 which is the default.

9.
 a). My display_final.c has 122 lines of code in it.
 b). There are 77 lines in the diff file.
