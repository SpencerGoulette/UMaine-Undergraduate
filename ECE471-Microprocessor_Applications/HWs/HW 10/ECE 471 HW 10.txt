(a) If you wanted maximum floating point (GFLOPS) performance with one ARM system (meaning,
not a cluster), which would you use?

According to Table 2, the single arm system with the maximum GFLOPS is the Jetson TX-1, which has 16 GFLOPS. So, I would use the Jetson TX-1.

(b) If you wanted lowest power under load with one ARM system, which board would you use?

According to Table 2, the single arm system with the lowest power under load is the Raspberry Pi Model A+, which has an average load power of 1.0. So, I would use the Raspberry Pi Model A+

(c) If you wanted maximum GFLOPs/W, which architecture should you use, x86 (Intel and AMD)
or ARM?

According to Table 2, the system with the maximum GFLOPs/W is the 16 core Intel Haswell-EP, which has x86 architecture. So, I would use the x86 architecture.

(d) If you wanted maximum MFLOPs per dollar, which architecture should you use, x86 (Intel and
AMD) or ARM?

According to Table 2, the system with the maximum MFLOPs per dollar is the 16 core Intel Haswell-EP, which has x86 architecture. So, I would use the x86 architecture.

(e) If you were personally building a compute cluster, what type of device would you make it out
of? Why?

I would probably use the 16 core Intel Haswell-EP because you get the most bang for your buck. Unfortunately, a drawback is the power used. Other than that, it seems to be the best.
