ECE 471 HW 11
Spencer Goulette

1.
	a. The machine that has the lowest under-load power draw is the Raspberry Pi 2.
	b. The machine that consumes the least amount of energy is the Macbook Air.
	c. The machine that computes the result fastest is the Macbook Air.

2. No, not all the boards listed could meet the deadline. The Jetson-TX1 and Macbook Air are the only ones that can meet this deadline.

3.
	a. Jetson TX-1 Energy in 1 hour = 60(2.1W(60s - 47s) + 13.4W(47s)) = 39,426 J
	b. Macbook Air Energy in 1 hour = 60(10.0W(60s - 14s) + 29.1W(14s)) = 52,044 J

4.	If I was running this project off a battery, I would choose the Jetson TX-1 since it uses less energy than the Macbook Air per hour to do this project.
