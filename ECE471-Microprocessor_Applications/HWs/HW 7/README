ECE471 Fall 2018 -- HW7

Name: Spencer Goulette

4. Describe your something cool: Gives the highest temperature recorded and updates it every minute.

5. a. I2C requires fewer wires and can transmit over longer distances than SPI.
   b. SPI is lower power and potentially faster than I2C. 
   c. This would not work because the voltage drop would be large over 150 feet, which would make the reading inaccurate.
   d. There might be linearity errors into the conversion when you bitbang SPI via GPIO on regular Linux. 

6. a. If you pipe a command to /dev/null, it disappears. It is like a bucket with a hole in it.
   b. If you pipe a command to /dev/full, the message returned is "No space left on device."
   c. One of the typical uses of /dev/zerp is to provide a character stream for initializing data.
   d. /dev/random I believe it serves the purpose as a pseudorandom number generator, so it contains a bunch of random numbers.
