COS 221 Data Structures
Homework Assignment #7
Due Date: 11/3/17
Textbook Reference:  Ch. 20, Pg. 44, Ex. 20.1
*20.1 (Implement remove(T element)) The implementation of remove(T element) is omitted in Listing 20.2, LinkedList.h. Implement it.

For input use this sentence, which you may code as a constant string:
"DURING the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of the year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, I had been passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of country; and at length found myself, as the shades of the evening drew on, within view of the melancholy House of Usher."
Your test case should show the string after being loaded into a linked list and then again after the word “of” has been removed.
