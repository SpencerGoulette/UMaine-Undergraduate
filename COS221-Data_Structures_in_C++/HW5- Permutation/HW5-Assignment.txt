(String permutations)Write a recursive function to print all permutations of a string. For example, for a string abc, the permutation is 
Abc
Acb
Bac
Bca
Cab
Cba
(Hint: Define the following two functions.  The second is a helper function.)
Void displayPermutation(const string& s)
Void displayPermutation(const string& s1, const string& s2)
The first function simply invokes displayPermutation(“”,s).  The second function uses a loop to move a character from s2 to s1 and recursively invoke it with a new s and s2. The base case is that s2 is empty and prints s1 to console.
Write a test program that prompts the user to enter a string and displays all its permutations. Note that output is O(N!) so pick a small string.
